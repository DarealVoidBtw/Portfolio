I am currently creating a weather widget for the website and 90% of it is done I just want to try add a hour by hour forecast to it and then it will be done I dont want to use Ip addresses for it because
they aren't accurate and can be thrown off by a VPN so for now it will be manual.

After the weather widget I intend to create one more interactive widget then the rest will be a CV one What I work in one and Another image or two.

Thats all.
